# **Bigram Language Model**  

A simple **Bigram Language Model** implemented from scratch in Python using PyTorch. This model learns to predict the next token in a sequence based on the previous token.  

## **Features** 🚀  

✅ Tokenization of input text  
✅ Bigram-based token embeddings  
✅ Simple neural network for learning bigram probabilities  
✅ Training loop with loss computation  
✅ Sampling from the trained model to generate text

## **Installation & Requirements** 📦  

Ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed. You can install dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

---

## **Usage** 🎯  

### **1. Training the Model**  
Modify the input.txt file, adding data that will be used for training, or keep the contents that are currently inside.

### **2. Generating Text**  
After training, generate text by running the following:  

```python
gpt.py
```

## **Hyperparameters & Configuration** ⚙️  

Modify these in the script to tune performance:  

```python
eval_iters = 200 # This is the number of iterations that the model is going to evaluate the loss for
n_embd = 128 # This is the number of embeddings that the model is going to use
n_head = 4 # This is the number of heads that the model is going to use
n_layer = 4 # This is the number of layers that the model is going to use
dropout = 0.1 # This is the dropout rate of the model
```
If you have a GPU, it will automatically use that. Depending on your computer's specs, you can adjust these for better and quicker results.

## **Model Architecture** 🏗️  

- **Embedding Layer:** Maps tokens to dense vectors  
- **Linear Layer:** Learns relationships between bigrams  
- **Softmax Output:** Converts scores into probabilities  

A simple example:  

```python
class BigramModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=-1)
```

## **Possible Improvements** 🚀  

🔹 **Use Trigrams or N-grams** to capture more context  
🔹 **Train on Larger Datasets** for improved generalization  
🔹 **Fine-tune with Transformers** like GPT for more realistic outputs
